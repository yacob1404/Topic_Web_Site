        <h2>What does your work at AFROTC entail?</h2>
        <p>
            That is a great question. Most often I spend my time in a class like most students <br />
            however we do participate in a lab section. In this lab section we practice everything <br />
            from room entry and clearing to busniess professionalism. It is a very large spectrum <br />
            of study. You can check out my detatchment <a href="https://www.sdstate.edu/air/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>How often do you participate in AFROTC?</h2>
        <p>
            Cadet are required to attend one class and one lab section a week. However it is strongly <br />
            encouraged that every cadet attend IMT (initial military training), this is one hour a week.<br />
            Cadets who are AS200 (second year cadets) are strongly encouraged to attend both IMt and FTP <br />
            (Field Training Practice). FTP is held twice a week for an hour each time, here you will be <br />
            prepared for field training.

        <h2>What exactly is Cyber Operations?</h2>
        <p>
            Cyber Operations is a program available at Dakota State University. This program details <br />
            offensive security measures in the pursuit of better security. The idea is you will know <br />
            how to protect your information if you know how to steal it. It is similar to protecting <br />
            your bank my trying to break into it. If you break into your own bank you should be able <br />
            to fix the security issues you used to break in.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>What sort of classes do you take in Cyber Operations?</h2>
        <p>
            A list of all the core classes can be found <a href="ProgramPath.html">here</a> or the full list at the DSU website <a href="http://dsu.edu/assets/uploads/resources/CyberOps-MAP.pdf">here</a>.

        <h2>What did you do at Computer Trouble Shooters of North Phoenix?</h2>
        <p>
            I spent most of my time setting up new Windows installations. This was a suprisingly time <br />
            consuming process. I also had to do basic hardware replacments, no soldering involved. Most <br />
            replacments were very basic from power supplies to R.A.M.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2>Are there any accomplishments at CTSNP you are proud of?</h2>
        <p>
            The whole experience was incredibly rewarding but one instance really sticks out. We had a <br />
            troubling HDD. This HDD would not let us delete a specific partition. Here is when I had to<br />
            learn about a program built into Windows. This program is accessed through the command prompt. <br />
            This program allowed me to delete the partition even though disk managment would not allow me to.
