        <blockquote>"War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things.<br />
        The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling,<br />
         which thinks that nothing is worth war, is much worse.<br />
        The person, who has nothing for which he is willing to fight<br />
        nothing which is more important than his own personal safety,<br />
        is a miserable creature and has no chance of being free unless<br />
        made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself."<br />
